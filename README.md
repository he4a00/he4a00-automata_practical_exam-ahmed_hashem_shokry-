##  Getting Started

No special setup required. This project uses plain JavaScript. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.

### Install dependencies (only needed to run tests)

```npm install```

## Run the Programs
```node src/problem1.js```
```node src/problem2.js```
```node src/problem3.js```

✅ Run Tests
This project uses Jest for testing.

To run all tests:
```npx jest```

To run a specific test file:
```npx jest test/problem2.test.js```

## Problem Descriptions
```Problem 1 – Simulate a DFA.```
```Problem 2 – Simulate a PDA that accepts balanced and nested strings.```
```Problem 3 – Simulate a Turing Machine that accepts strings of the form ww.```

## Technologies Used
```Node.js```
```Jest (for unit testing)```
